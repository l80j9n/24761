Teaching and learning strategies 
The subject   is based on dynamic and   interactive   lecture and workshop   sessions.
The lectures   involve   critical debate and in-depth   case   deliberations;   and   the workshops   are   built   around   in-class exercises, case discussions and presentations. These classes will   be   supplemented with   both   printed   and   electronic learning   materials and resources. The learning management   system   will   be   used   to   share   information   and   encourage   interaction between staff and students. Students will also   use appropriate   computer   software   such   as   spreadsheets and word processors to complete assigned tasks.
All students will be provided with the opportunity for   initial feedback   on   their   performance   in   the   subject   during   the   first   four weeks of the semester.
Further feedback will   be   provided   in relation to submitted assessment tasks.   In   addition,   student   groups will collaborate and engage   in active learning tasks such   as   case   study   analysis,   problem   solving   exercises   and   group discussions, to discuss their learning with their peers and they   will   receive   constructive   feedback   on   the   assigned   tasks.
